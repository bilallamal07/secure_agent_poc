	•	Data Handling: The privileged LLM invokes the quarantined LLM with arbitrary prompts to process individual data items (e.g., emails), storing results in symbolic variables for later retrieval.
	•	Flexibility and Task Delegation: This approach offers flexibility as the privileged LLM can dispatch the quarantined LLM with any target prompt to perform specific tasks on the data.
	•	Code-Then-Execute Pattern: The agent generates an entire program (e.g., a Python script) before seeing any untrusted input, allowing for complex logic and handling of more complex operations.
	•	Camel Pattern: A further extension of the code-then-execute pattern, adding fine-grained security by attaching explicit policies to each tool and data flow, ensuring compliance before any action is executed.

	•	Data Flow Tracking and Policy Enforcement: Implement a policy to restrict the input strings of the quarantined LLM to a single source, preventing potential data exfiltration through prompt injection.
	•	Context Minimization Pattern: Extract a structured representation of user intent and discard the original prompt to prevent hidden instructions from influencing the agent’s response.

	•	Robust Security: Robust security for LLM agents comes from engineering patterns and domain-specific tasks, not just prompt engineering.






# Guide to Securing LLM Agents Against Prompt Injection
This guide outlines key points regarding the design patterns for mitigating prompt injection risks in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It is structured to provide a clear understanding of the vulnerabilities, proposed solutions, and practical applications of these design patterns.

1. Introduction to LLM Agents
Definition: LLM agents are systems built around language models that can process data, interpret instructions, and interact with the external environment.
Vulnerability: These agents are susceptible to prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions can manipulate their actions, leading to unintended consequences.
2. The Challenge of Prompt Injection
Prompt Injection Threat: Attackers can embed harmful instructions within user inputs, hijacking the LLM's execution flow. This poses significant security risks, including data leakage and unauthorised actions.
Limitations of Current Defences: Existing strategies, such as prompt engineering and user confirmations, have scalability and effectiveness limitations.
3. Proposed Solutions: Design Patterns
To enhance the security of LLM agents, six architectural design patterns are proposed. Each pattern aims to balance security and utility while constraining the capabilities of the agents.

3.1 Action-Selector Pattern
Functionality: This is the most restrictive pattern, limiting agent actions to predefined options. It ensures strong security against prompt injection by preventing arbitrary behaviours.
Trade-off: While it enhances security, it lacks flexibility, as the agent can only perform actions anticipated by developers.
3.2 Plan-Then-Execute Pattern
Functionality: This pattern allows the agent to generate a complete action plan before interacting with untrusted data, maintaining control flow integrity.
Parameter Handling: The LLM can only fill in placeholders (e.g., email body) without altering the action sequence or fixed parameters.
3.3 Dual LLM Pattern
Functionality: Utilises two LLMs: a privileged LLM for planning and tool usage, and a quarantined LLM for processing untrusted data. This separation prevents contamination.
Security Mechanism: The privileged LLM invokes the quarantined LLM with arbitrary prompts, ensuring security even if the quarantined LLM is compromised.
3.4 Code-Then-Execute Pattern
Functionality: The agent generates a complete program (e.g., a Python script) before encountering untrusted input, allowing for complex logic and operations.
Security Measures: This pattern includes fine-grained security policies attached to each tool and data flow, ensuring compliance before execution.
3.5 Context-Minimisation Pattern
Functionality: This pattern extracts a structured representation of user intent and discards the original prompt, preventing hidden instructions from influencing the agent’s response.
Data Flow Tracking: It enforces a single source policy to prevent data mixing and potential attacks.
3.6 LLM Map-Reduce Pattern
Functionality: Sub-agents process untrusted content in isolation, with results aggregated by a coordinator. This mitigates the risk of malicious instructions affecting the overall system.
Data Validation: Strict schema validation ensures only valid data is processed.

4. Case Studies and Applications
The paper presents ten case studies illustrating the application of these design patterns across various domains, including:

Operating system assistants
SQL agents
Email assistants
Customer service chatbots
Booking assistants
Product recommenders
Resume screening assistants
Medication leaflet chatbots
Medical diagnosis chatbots
Software engineering agents
4.1 Safe API Consumption
In the Software Engineering Agent case study, a quarantined LLM is used to convert untrusted documentation into a strictly formatted API description, minimising the risk of prompt injections.

5. Security Considerations
Method Name Length: Allowing method names to be excessively long (e.g., over 30 characters) may pose security risks.
User Permission and Confirmation: Implementing least privilege for agents and requiring user confirmation for high-stakes actions can prevent unauthorised actions.
Operational Controls: Enforcing per-user rate limits and content moderation lockouts helps prevent resource exhaustion and system tampering.
6. Conclusion
Robust security for LLM agents is achievable through thoughtful system design and application-specific constraints. The proposed design patterns provide a framework for building secure LLM agents that can effectively mitigate the risks associated with prompt injection attacks. Future research should focus on formal verification methods, automated security analysis tools, and sophisticated constraint mechanisms for LLM behaviour.

By understanding and implementing these design patterns, developers can create more secure and reliable LLM agents, ultimately enhancing their utility while safeguarding against potential threats.

Tooling that once you add a mcp server notify you any tooling changes if discretion change 
The protocol it self has a mechanism  allows a server to send a signal said hey this tooling has changed that on server to implement that on client to do something with that if they get it 
Over of this to notified a user for any tooling using map  changed 


We are developing a tooling system that, once you add an MCP server, automatically notifies you of any tooling changes, especially if there are changes in permissions or configurations.

The protocol itself includes a mechanism that allows the server to send a signal indicating that tooling has changed. This enables the client to respond appropriately when such a notification is received.

Overall, this system ensures that users are promptly informed of any tooling changes—such as updates to the tooling map—so they can take the necessary actions.
